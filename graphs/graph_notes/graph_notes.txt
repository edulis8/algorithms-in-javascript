In the context of a connected, undirected graph:


SELF LOOPS
"No self loops" means that there are no edges that start and end on the same vertex. In other words, a vertex cannot have an edge that connects it to itself.

REPEATED EDGES
"No repeated edges" means that there are no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. In other words, if there is an edge connecting vertex A to vertex B, there cannot be another edge that also connects vertex A to vertex B.

A connected, undirected graph with no self loops and no repeated edges is often referred to as a simple graph.
