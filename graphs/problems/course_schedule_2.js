// "Topological sort" (or "topological ordering") is a linear ordering of the vertices (nodes) in a directed graph such that for every directed 
// edge (u, v), vertex "u" comes before vertex "v" in the ordering. 
// In simpler terms, it arranges the nodes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear order such that all dependencies flow from left to right.
