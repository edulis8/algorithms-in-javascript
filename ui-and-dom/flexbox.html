<!-- 
1) The Flex container
2) The flex items

 - Majority of layout work done in flex container
 - items listen to what the flex container says
 - (You can also do overrides on the items)

 - display:flex creates a flex container
 - set the main axis with flex-direction
 - control wrapping rules with flex-wrap
 - set default MAIN and CROSS axis alignment
 - justify-content = main axis
 - align-items = cross axis



 justify-content:
 - alignment is along the main axis
 - what happens with the leftover free space
 - most common are flex-start and flex-end and center
 - there's also space-between, space-around and space-evenly


 FLEX ITEMS:

 order:
 - change the order that the flex items render

 flex: <grow>, -shrink>, <basis> 
  The flex-grow property determines how much a flex item should grow relative to other flex items when there's available space within the flex container.
 
 align-self: <position>
  - change the cross-axis alignment for ONE OF THE items
  - flex-start, flex-end
