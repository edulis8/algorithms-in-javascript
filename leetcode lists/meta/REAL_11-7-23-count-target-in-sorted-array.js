// given array such as [10,10,10,20,20,20,30,30,30,34]
// given target such as 20
// return count of target
// return 3


// use binary search
// REMEMBER A BINARY SEARCH DIVIDES AND ONLY SEARCHES ONE SIDE, or else you're just searching everything!

// somehow find firstIndex and lastIndex of 20s using binary search

// hints
// only recurse left or right if necessary
// if you've found 30 for example, only recurse left side
// if you've found 10, only recurse right side


// Look at this
// https://www.techiedelight.com/count-occurrences-number-sorted-array-duplicates/

// Count occurrences of a number in a sorted array with duplicates


// you couldn't implement regular binary search but you tried. see notes/binary_search_recursive for how it should go.
